# 📊 Global Terrorism Database (GTD) Big Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global terrorism trends using the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**. We employ **big data techniques** to identify patterns, hotspots, and attack trends, enabling deeper insights into the evolution of terrorism worldwide.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- **Trend Analysis** – Explore how terrorism has evolved over time across different regions.
- **Hotspot Detection** – Identify countries and cities with the highest terrorist activity.
- **Attack Patterns** – Analyze attack types, weapons used, and their frequency.

## 📂 Dataset
We use the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**, which includes information on terrorist incidents from **1970 to 2021**.

- **Source:** National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START)
- **Size:** 200,000+ records
- **Variables:** Date, location, attack type, weapons, casualties, responsible groups, etc.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data processing and analysis)
- **MongoDB** (for data storing)
- **Dask** (for big data parallel processing)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (for data manipulation)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive analysis)

## 📊 Analysis and Visualizations
✅ **Time-Series Analysis:** Trends in terrorist attacks over decades.  
✅ **Geospatial Visualization:** Insights to detect high-risk regions.  
✅ **Attack Pattern Analysis:** Insights into methods and frequency of attacks.   

## 📜 Results & Findings
- **Significant increase in terrorism incidents from 2000 to 2016**, with a peak around 2014-2015.
- **Countries most affected:** Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria.
- **Bombings/Explosions** are the most common attack type (~50% of incidents).
- **Firearms and explosives** are the predominant weapons used.
